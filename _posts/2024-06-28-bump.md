[2024/06/28 11:34]  Dizzi Sternberg: are we doing any stuff up in S1 tonight?
[2024/06/28 11:34]  Janet Rossini: idk
[2024/06/28 11:34]  NightShade Fugu: we could  do a little  Bump mapp understanding
[2024/06/28 11:34]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/28 11:34]  NightShade Fugu: If janet is  up  to it
[2024/06/28 11:34]  Dizzi Sternberg: just an hour?
[2024/06/28 11:34]  Janet Rossini: ok
[2024/06/28 11:34]  NightShade Fugu: Yes
[2024/06/28 11:34]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/28 11:35]  Dizzi Sternberg: at the lakeside maybe?
[2024/06/28 11:35]  NightShade Fugu: Ok that  should be  ok
[2024/06/28 11:35]  Janet Rossini: ok
[2024/06/28 11:35]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/28 11:36]  NightShade Fugu: So i  think we  been tough  how  to add a  buimp map  to a texture
[2024/06/28 11:36]  Dizzi Sternberg: so you are noticing things ar much nicer colours now janet?
[2024/06/28 11:36]  NightShade Fugu: and last time we saw how  one canmake a texture
[2024/06/28 11:36]  Janet Rossini: yes and i do get m inimal reflections
[2024/06/28 11:36]  Janet Rossini: ok listening to night
[2024/06/28 11:36]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/28 11:36]  NightShade Fugu: and  draw on that to make a  bumps
[2024/06/28 11:36]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/28 11:37]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/28 11:37]  NightShade Fugu: So that is  en  way but  it is  of course also to  use an external bump map
[2024/06/28 11:37]  NightShade Fugu: like we did with the  Ai generated gray  pictures
[2024/06/28 11:37]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/28 11:37]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/28 11:37]  NightShade Fugu: load a  gray  map  file
[2024/06/28 11:37]  NightShade Fugu: and then include that
[2024/06/28 11:38]  NightShade Fugu: IN order to use that  - the  external  option
[2024/06/28 11:38]  NightShade Fugu: one  need to know where to draw
[2024/06/28 11:38]  Janet Rossini: right
[2024/06/28 11:38]  NightShade Fugu: and in order to get that information
[2024/06/28 11:38]  NightShade Fugu: the UV mapping  can be exported as a  file
[2024/06/28 11:39]  NightShade Fugu: and one can use PS to  guide how  to draw the  bump map
[2024/06/28 11:39]  NightShade Fugu: So today we try  to make that
[2024/06/28 11:39]  Janet Rossini: hm ok
[2024/06/28 11:39]  NightShade Fugu: and then  bake the  new normal map
[2024/06/28 11:39]  NightShade Fugu: So we  can start  as always  with a  cube
[2024/06/28 11:40]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/28 11:41]  NightShade Fugu: and then  we like to have a texture
[2024/06/28 11:41]  NightShade Fugu: Old Brass
[2024/06/28 11:41]  NightShade Fugu: will be  good  if we search that
[2024/06/28 11:41]  Janet Rossini: please mention what layout you're in
[2024/06/28 11:42]  NightShade Fugu: that will be  shading
[2024/06/28 11:42]  Dizzi Sternberg: shall we start from a cube again?
[2024/06/28 11:42]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/28 11:42]  NightShade Fugu: yes  start with a  cube  always  good
[2024/06/28 11:42]  NightShade Fugu: then  find
[2024/06/28 11:42]  NightShade Fugu: old brass texture
[2024/06/28 11:42]  NightShade Fugu: and add to the  cube
[2024/06/28 11:43]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/28 11:43]  NightShade Fugu: the  next thing is  to  unwrap the  cube
[2024/06/28 11:43]  NightShade Fugu: so we have a  nice UV  system
[2024/06/28 11:44]  NightShade Fugu: and there is  of c ouse many  ways
[2024/06/28 11:44]  NightShade Fugu: bu  basically one goes to the  UV editor mode
[2024/06/28 11:45]  NightShade Fugu: "UV Editing
[2024/06/28 11:46]  NightShade Fugu: and then maybe apply a  few seams
[2024/06/28 11:46]  NightShade Fugu: and  do a unwrap
[2024/06/28 11:47]  NightShade Fugu: or  one can  jsut  let  it  do by  it  self
[2024/06/28 11:47]  Janet Rossini: i did UV Unwrap and nothing happened on the picture
[2024/06/28 11:47]  NightShade Fugu: https://gyazo.com/b11997c6ccee94380b487332e7d25881
[2024/06/28 11:47]  NightShade Fugu: you  select the  cube
[2024/06/28 11:48]  NightShade Fugu: go in  edit mode
[2024/06/28 11:48]  NightShade Fugu: select all
[2024/06/28 11:48]  NightShade Fugu: press U for  unwrap
[2024/06/28 11:48]  NightShade Fugu: and you should see the  unwrapped lines on the picture frame
[2024/06/28 11:48]  NightShade Fugu: is all  the  cube is  selected
[2024/06/28 11:48]  NightShade Fugu: in edit mode
[2024/06/28 11:48]  NightShade Fugu: all borders
[2024/06/28 11:49]  Janet Rossini: made a very weird decision, two squares and a rectangle
[2024/06/28 11:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: same here
[2024/06/28 11:49]  NightShade Fugu: yes it is   the  tupical UV
[2024/06/28 11:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: mark those seams ?
[2024/06/28 11:49]  NightShade Fugu: make some  wierd choices
[2024/06/28 11:49]  NightShade Fugu: thay  is  why  i always  operate with seams
[2024/06/28 11:49]  NightShade Fugu: i  decide the  unwrap
[2024/06/28 11:49]  Janet Rossini: two of them are on top of each other in fact
[2024/06/28 11:50]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/28 11:50]  NightShade Fugu: so  should  be  ok ?
[2024/06/28 11:50]  NightShade Fugu: for  now  ti is  nto a  talk about  unvrapping
[2024/06/28 11:50]  NightShade Fugu: ita  chapter on its  own
[2024/06/28 11:50]  Dizzi Sternberg: shall we mark the seams like you did here https://gyazo.com/b11997c6ccee94380b487332e7d25881
[2024/06/28 11:50]  NightShade Fugu: yes then you shoudl  get the  same
[2024/06/28 11:51]  NightShade Fugu: https://gyazo.com/1f7788758a500036b264a98f59f42b54
[2024/06/28 11:52]  NightShade Fugu: So if we have an  unwrapped cube
[2024/06/28 11:52]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok got the inverted cross
[2024/06/28 11:53]  NightShade Fugu: yes
[2024/06/28 11:53]  NightShade Fugu: dosent matter  Dizzi
[2024/06/28 11:53]  NightShade Fugu: we just need some  unwrap
[2024/06/28 11:53]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/28 11:53]  NightShade Fugu: Ok next it  to actually  get that map
[2024/06/28 11:54]  NightShade Fugu: to become a  file we can work  on
[2024/06/28 11:54]  Janet Rossini: ok i finally got something i can live with
[2024/06/28 11:54]  NightShade Fugu: and fortunately  in the main meny  in the  image  display  under UV
[2024/06/28 11:54]  Eye of Odin HUD to wear: + Kaðlín Björnsdottir (pyw Hoof)  [4]
[2024/06/28 11:54]  NightShade Fugu: there si an  option to export  UV layout
[2024/06/28 11:54]  Eye of Odin HUD to wear: - Kaðlín Björnsdottir (pyw Hoof)  [3]
[2024/06/28 11:55]  NightShade Fugu: so with all the  borders of the  cube s elected
[2024/06/28 11:55]  NightShade Fugu: on can go  to the  image  panel
[2024/06/28 11:55]  NightShade Fugu: select UV/Export UV Layout
[2024/06/28 11:55]  Janet Rossini: yes exported cube.png
[2024/06/28 11:56]  NightShade Fugu: yes
[2024/06/28 11:56]  NightShade Fugu: and that  picture has the  black line  of the  UV layout
[2024/06/28 11:57]  NightShade Fugu: gray is  the objet  faces and tranparent is  no  part of the  uv
[2024/06/28 11:57]  NightShade Fugu: So one can open that in PS
[2024/06/28 11:57]  NightShade Fugu: and then paint on a  new layer
[2024/06/28 11:57]  NightShade Fugu: the  Bump map  one like to  have
[2024/06/28 11:58]  Janet Rossini: when exporting that map will we export only the layer we drew on, or both?
[2024/06/28 11:58]  Janet Rossini: (trying to figure out how best to draw given no PS here)
[2024/06/28 11:58]  Dizzi Sternberg: mm
[2024/06/28 11:58]  NightShade Fugu: Yes i see janet
[2024/06/28 11:58]  Dizzi Sternberg: you need a drawing package with layers
[2024/06/28 11:59]  Dizzi Sternberg: Krita?
[2024/06/28 11:59]  NightShade Fugu: One  need some  way to  have a layerd image
[2024/06/28 11:59]  Janet Rossini: yes i can do that, i'm looking ahead to see how to set it up. anyway proceeding
[2024/06/28 11:59]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/28 11:59]  NightShade Fugu: Yes i  think
[2024/06/28 12:00]  NightShade Fugu: the  thing  one  do then is  to find the  right place to add thing
[2024/06/28 12:00]  NightShade Fugu: it  can be a  big problem
[2024/06/28 12:00]  NightShade Fugu: like the  cube  we have
[2024/06/28 12:00]  NightShade Fugu: what is  up and  down
[2024/06/28 12:00]  NightShade Fugu: and how  to  orientate  you self in the  image
[2024/06/28 12:00]  NightShade Fugu: So often i  use  two  images
[2024/06/28 12:01]  NightShade Fugu: one where  i mark  elements with the  textures draw
[2024/06/28 12:01]  NightShade Fugu: and then export  that
[2024/06/28 12:01]  NightShade Fugu: and then export the  UV
[2024/06/28 12:01]  Dizzi Sternberg: i used to paint on the surface like we used last and write 1 2 3 ...6 on the sides
[2024/06/28 12:01]  NightShade Fugu: and then  make the  real bumpmap  on a  3rd layer
[2024/06/28 12:01]  Dizzi Sternberg: and esport that
[2024/06/28 12:01]  NightShade Fugu: Yes
[2024/06/28 12:01]  NightShade Fugu: Other  tome it is  obvious
[2024/06/28 12:02]  NightShade Fugu: you have a  side fo a  houese with  windows
[2024/06/28 12:02]  Janet Rossini: yes. remind me what colors to use?
[2024/06/28 12:02]  NightShade Fugu: not  hard to  figure out  what is  what
[2024/06/28 12:02]  NightShade Fugu: If you like to make a bump map
[2024/06/28 12:02]  NightShade Fugu: it is  onely  takign  black  and  white  info
[2024/06/28 12:03]  Janet Rossini: not gray?
[2024/06/28 12:03]  NightShade Fugu: Yes  gray scaled
[2024/06/28 12:03]  Janet Rossini: should one fill with a neutral gray or just draw?
[2024/06/28 12:03]  Janet Rossini: white is up, black is down?
[2024/06/28 12:04]  NightShade Fugu: yes
[2024/06/28 12:04]  Dizzi Sternberg: i start with a 128,128,128 fill?
[2024/06/28 12:04]  NightShade Fugu: yes
[2024/06/28 12:04]  NightShade Fugu: and then  when you are happy
[2024/06/28 12:04]  NightShade Fugu: you can insert that picture as a bump map
[2024/06/28 12:04]  NightShade Fugu: just before then  normal input to the  Principal shader
[2024/06/28 12:05]  NightShade Fugu: like we saw  before
[2024/06/28 12:05]  Janet Rossini: hm now of course i can't see the lines
[2024/06/28 12:05]  NightShade Fugu: you have to select the  object
[2024/06/28 12:06]  NightShade Fugu: all lines in  edit mode
[2024/06/28 12:06]  Dizzi Sternberg: i usualy put the UV out as the top layer
[2024/06/28 12:06]  NightShade Fugu: while  in the  UV  editor
[2024/06/28 12:06]  Janet Rossini: yes just figured that out :)
[2024/06/28 12:06]  NightShade Fugu: Yes i  do  too - since it is  transparent
[2024/06/28 12:06]  Janet Rossini: i am still working out how to draw on the thing
[2024/06/28 12:06]  Dizzi Sternberg: we could try and make a dice?
[2024/06/28 12:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: draw black dots?

[2024/06/28 12:31]  NightShade Fugu: to make  room for the   two
[2024/06/28 12:31]  NightShade Fugu: so 1)  Bumpmap  just before the  normal  input to the  principal shader
[2024/06/28 12:31]  Janet Rossini: too fast
[2024/06/28 12:31]  NightShade Fugu: getting the  roginal normal input
[2024/06/28 12:32]  Dizzi Sternberg: i cant see the text in your screengrab night

[2024/06/28 12:41]  Janet Rossini: is getting it out, i hope
[2024/06/28 12:41]  NightShade Fugu: we jhave to  controll the Bump Node
[2024/06/28 12:41]  NightShade Fugu: We have a several option in that
[2024/06/28 12:41]  NightShade Fugu: to change  what we  do
[2024/06/28 12:41]  NightShade Fugu: The first element is the DIstance
[2024/06/28 12:42]  NightShade Fugu: I  told you last time not to play  with  that
[2024/06/28 12:42]  NightShade Fugu: But was to amke  things  simpler
[2024/06/28 12:42]  NightShade Fugu: Image you liek to make  bumps
[2024/06/28 12:42]  NightShade Fugu: and you have some idear of the  hight  or dept of  them
[2024/06/28 12:42]  NightShade Fugu: then the value shoudl be set to the max value  you  like
[2024/06/28 12:42]  NightShade Fugu: here maybe  10 cm
[2024/06/28 12:43]  NightShade Fugu: so the  Distance shoudl be like  0.1
[2024/06/28 12:43]  NightShade Fugu: and i f you notice
[2024/06/28 12:43]  NightShade Fugu: the bump are mich  less jerky
[2024/06/28 12:44]  NightShade Fugu: So  one  tune  the  distance
[2024/06/28 12:44]  NightShade Fugu: into a setting where the  bumps  hight  is  about  the  expected visually
[2024/06/28 12:44]  NightShade Fugu: I may  go to  0.2
[2024/06/28 12:44]  NightShade Fugu: and will ebhappy  in my  model
[2024/06/28 12:45]  Janet Rossini: doesn't make much difference tho?
[2024/06/28 12:45]  NightShade Fugu: the  strength  can then  be  use t  determine  the  influence
[2024/06/28 12:45]  NightShade Fugu: No but  what it  does  janet
[2024/06/28 12:45]  NightShade Fugu: is  to smooth  the  side of  you  bumps a bit
[2024/06/28 12:46]  Janet Rossini: ah
[2024/06/28 12:46]  NightShade Fugu: then other thign to use is of course the  strength
[2024/06/28 12:47]  NightShade Fugu: so  those  values are nearly always  adjusted
[2024/06/28 12:47]  NightShade Fugu: ontill one  is pleased wit the  result
[2024/06/28 12:47]  NightShade Fugu: and it  dosent affect the  other normal map
[2024/06/28 12:47]  NightShade Fugu: since it is  just added on  top
[2024/06/28 12:47]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/28 12:48]  NightShade Fugu: You can alse see that the bumps  Dizzi and  i have
[2024/06/28 12:48]  NightShade Fugu: are a bit like  pyramids
[2024/06/28 12:48]  NightShade Fugu: that of couse depend on the  fall of  of the  brush one  use
[2024/06/28 12:49]  NightShade Fugu: how the  gray is converted into hight
[2024/06/28 12:49]  Janet Rossini: yes i couldn't find a brush that wasn't solid but i have them somewhere
[2024/06/28 12:50]  NightShade Fugu: yes
[2024/06/28 12:50]  Janet Rossini: do we have time for a quick reminder of how to get this onto an SL object?
[2024/06/28 12:50]  Janet Rossini: getting kind of late
[2024/06/28 12:51]  NightShade Fugu: yes

[2024/06/28 12:51]  NightShade Fugu: If  you  fisrst can see the  effet of the bump map  on your  model  it is  super easy to make a new Normal map
[2024/06/28 12:51]  NightShade Fugu: Yes we can save
[2024/06/28 12:53]  NightShade Fugu: So we  have all the  tools to add a  bumpmap
[2024/06/28 12:53]  NightShade Fugu: what ever in most convinient for the  situation
[2024/06/28 12:53]  NightShade Fugu: I  used PS and Blender to do  it
[2024/06/28 12:54]  NightShade Fugu: and i  think i get more and more  fond of  using the  Draw on the  object directly  option for line and  doth
[2024/06/28 12:54]  NightShade Fugu: and for  figures i am using  PS
[2024/06/28 12:54]  Janet Rossini: yes ... if i can get it to display on my iPad i would like that as well

[2024/06/28 12:57]  Dizzi Sternberg: as you created a UV for it
