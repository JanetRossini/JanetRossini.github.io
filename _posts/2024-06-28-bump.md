title: Bump Nodes

---

DS: are we doing any stuff up in S1 tonight?

JR: idk

NS: we could  do a little  Bump mapp understanding
DS: ok

NS: If janet is  up  to it
DS: just an hour?

JR: ok

NS: Yes
DS: ok

DS: at the lakeside maybe?

NS: Ok that  should be  ok
JR: ok

DS: yes

NS: So i  think we  been tough  how  to add a  buimp map  to a texture
DS: so you are noticing things ar much nicer colours now janet?

NS: and last time we saw how  one canmake a texture
JR: yes and i do get m inimal reflections

JR: ok listening to night

DS: yes

NS: and  draw on that to make a  bumps
JR: yes

DS: yes

NS: So that is  en  way but  it is  of course also to  use an external bump map  like we did with the  Ai generated gray  pictures
JR: yes

DS: yes

NS: load a  gray  map  file  and then include that IN order to use that  - the  external  option  one  need to know where to draw
JR: right

NS: and in order to get that information  the UV mapping  can be exported as a  file and one can use PS to  guide how  to draw the  bump map  So today we try  to make that
JR: hm ok

NS: and then  bake the  new normal map  So we  can start  as always  with a  cube
JR: yes

NS: and then  we like to have a texture  Old Brass will be  good  if we search that
JR: please mention what layout you're in

NS: that will be  shading
DS: shall we start from a cube again?

DS: ok

NS: yes  start with a  cube  always  good  then  find old brass texture  and add to the  cube
JR: yes

NS: the  next thing is  to  unwrap the  cube  so we have a  nice UV  system and there is  of c ouse many  ways  bu  basically one goes to the  UV editor mode "UV Editing  and then maybe apply a  few seams and  do a unwrap  or  one can  jsut  let  it  do by  it  self
JR: i did UV Unwrap and nothing happened on the picture

NS:
![image](/assets/b11997c6ccee94380b487332e7d25881.png)

NS: you  select the  cube  go in  edit mode select all  press U for  unwrap and you should see the  unwrapped lines on the picture frame  is all  the  cube is  selected in edit mode  all borders
JR: made a very weird decision, two squares and a rectangle

DS: same here

NS: yes it is   the  tupical UV
DS: mark those seams ?

NS: make some  wierd choices  thay  is  why  i always  operate with seams i  decide the  unwrap
JR: two of them are on top of each other in fact

DS: yes

NS: so  should  be  ok ?  for  now  ti is  nto a  talk about  unvrapping ita  chapter on its  own
DS: shall we mark the seams like you did here

![image](/assets/b11997c6ccee94380b487332e7d25881.png)

NS: yes then you shoudl  get the  same
NS:
![image](/assets/1f7788758a500036b264a98f59f42b54.png)

NS: So if we have an  unwrapped cube
DS: ok got the inverted cross

NS: yes  dosent matter  Dizzi we just need some  unwrap
DS: yes

NS: Ok next it  to actually  get that map  to become a  file we can work  on
JR: ok i finally got something i can live with

NS: and fortunately  in the main meny  in the  image  display  under UV there si an  option to export  UV layout
NS: so with all the  borders of the  cube s elected  on can go  to the  image  panel select UV/Export UV Layout
JR: yes exported cube.png

NS: yes  and that  picture has the  black line  of the  UV layout gray is  the objet  faces and tranparent is  no  part of the  uv  So one can open that in PS and then paint on a  new layer  the  Bump map  one like to  have
JR: when exporting that map will we export only the layer we drew on, or both?

JR: (trying to figure out how best to draw given no PS here)

DS: mm

NS: Yes i see janet
DS: you need a drawing package with layers

DS: Krita?

NS: One  need some  way to  have a layerd image
JR: yes i can do that, i'm looking ahead to see how to set it up. anyway proceeding

DS: ok

NS: Yes i  think  the  thing  one  do then is  to find the  right place to add thing it  can be a  big problem  like the  cube  we have what is  up and  down  and how  to  orientate  you self in the  image So often i  use  two  images  one where  i mark  elements with the  textures draw and then export  that  and then export the  UV
DS: i used to paint on the surface like we used last and write 1 2 3 ...6 on the sides

NS: and then  make the  real bumpmap  on a  3rd layer
DS: and esport that

NS: Yes  Other  tome it is  obvious you have a  side fo a  houese with  windows
JR: yes. remind me what colors to use?

NS: not  hard to  figure out  what is  what  If you like to make a bump map it is  onely  takign  black  and  white  info
JR: not gray?

NS: Yes  gray scaled
JR: should one fill with a neutral gray or just draw?

JR: white is up, black is down?

NS: yes
DS: i start with a 128,128,128 fill?

NS: yes  and then  when you are happy you can insert that picture as a bump map  just before then  normal input to the  Principal shader like we saw  before
JR: hm now of course i can't see the lines

NS: you have to select the  object  all lines in  edit mode
DS: i usualy put the UV out as the top layer

NS: while  in the  UV  editor
JR: yes just figured that out :)

NS: Yes i  do  too - since it is  transparent
JR: i am still working out how to draw on the thing

DS: we could try and make a dice?

DS: draw black dots?

NS: Yes  sould  eb  a  good try so i made this  in PS
NS:
![image](/assets/7a85dad1d23e4518cbf4bf70fb9bf528.png)

NS: uv layer on top  and some  doth shoudl be  black  really  lol  it is  holes
DS: white dots?

NS: yes
DS: ok

NS: lol  need to be  black
DS: black

JR: ok what should i export, just the layer i drew on?

DS: yess

NS: yes  just the layer  else the lines  will be part of the  bumps then  when we have that file  we can import to Blender Using the  Image/Open  S  i got  somethign liek this
NS:
![image](/assets/3bb69685f5580fbcabb26b7cc9f0df9c.png)

NS: the lines are because i have tthe  mesh selected in the  UV  editor  not  apart fo the picture
JR: i messed up starting over

NS: Ok  Janet
DS: yes takes a while

DS: i messed up too

DS: i hate PS

DS: :)

NS: Smiles
DS: bye the way night the dice is weird, oposite sides have to had to 7

DS: add

NS: yes it  uv map  is   somhow  ramdom
DS:

![image](/assets/927444473f8cd52e5926c4f4679692af.png)

NS: Look ok  Dizzi
DS: yes

NS: So  if  you have the picture into  Blender  let me know
JR: sorry for sloth trying to get pic back to pc

DS: ok

DS: np

NS: smiles  np
JR: ok, sorry someone at door

NS: Smiels
DS: :)

JR: ok i have pic on desktop ready to go, sorry i'm so slow, had to figure out how to move back and forth to ipad

NS: Dizzi  you can  try to set  up the  bump map
DS: yes

NS: no problem  janet
JR: now go back to shader?

NS: Now  import to blender
DS: ill just keep up with janet

NS: then go to the  shader  Ok and we  go  into the  node  window  inthe  shader
DS: yes

JR: how do i import it?

NS: in image menu  there is a  open  picture or  you can drag it  in  or  use the  texture node in the  image  display   you   fing a meny  called image
JR: ah found it

JR: ok it is in

DS: in the hambuger

NS: o  next is  to add the  bump  mapping  yes inthe  hamburger You  remember we  add a bump map node and an image  node  and the s etup  si like  this
NS:
![image](/assets/a09a09619789f1fa220a0908258731ca.png)

NS: you can drag the  other nodes aside  to make  room for the   two so 1)  Bumpmap  just before the  normal  input to the  principal shader
JR: too fast

NS: getting the  roginal normal input
DS: i cant see the text in your screengrab night

NS: if you click to enlarge ?
DS: yes even then

NS: ok i make a detail
NS:
![image](/assets/f5bc22ac3545f40868ab968f5a7b47ef.png)

DS: thanks

NS: the normal  input to the texture is  of course the  UV  map  the  mapping input
JR: is the cube map thing an image node?

NS: yes the  texture  you made Jananet is  the  Immage  you need to  have in the  image  node  so you can select  from the  node the  image  to  use
NS:
![image](/assets/4f7dd61179604eac0e530ba14e3e8677.png)

DS: woot

NS: i ahave more textures  looking for a  good  texture
JR: also woot

NS: In the  Image node
DS:

![image](/assets/65a0fbb10607e9298cfcf32ef49f74d7.png)

NS: there is a  field  to select the  texture open that and then you can select the  image  you  like  the little  icon of a mountain and a  sun
JR: yes got that. pic on screen is good

NS: inthat line  one have  also  option to  open a  image
DS: :)

NS: so  if  the  image is  in  and the node is  connected you  should  see the  bumps
JR: yes i see the bumps. woot = i see the bumps :)

NS: SMiles  All see  bumps my look liek  this
JR: yes

NS:
![image](/assets/20a687f8b92fe437d5c320127055db92.png)

DS:

![image](/assets/57325d5d6c32ac11f3195f0891f148d7.png)

NS: very  simmilar
JR:

![image](/assets/ee821384cd4a75bb8f3ecad4376afd76.jpg)

NS: and  nice artistic  Janet
DS: :)

JR: i personally hand-crafted that. LOL

NS: Ok  the last thign for  today  Yes lol
JR: is getting it out, i hope

NS: we jhave to  controll the Bump Node  We have a several option in that to change  what we  do  The first element is the DIstance I  told you last time not to play  with  that  But was to amke  things  simpler Image you liek to make  bumps  and you have some idear of the  hight  or dept of  them
NS: then the value shoudl be set to the max value  you  like  here maybe  10 cm so the  Distance shoudl be like  0.1  and i f you notice the bump are mich  less jerky  So  one  tune  the  distance into a setting where the  bumps  hight  is  about  the  expected visually  I may  go to  0.2
NS: and will ebhappy  in my  model
JR: doesn't make much difference tho?

NS: the  strength  can then  be  use t  determine  the  influence  No but  what it  does  janet is  to smooth  the  side of  you  bumps a bit
JR: ah

NS: then other thign to use is of course the  strength  so  those  values are nearly always  adjusted ontill one  is pleased wit the  result  and it  dosent affect the  other normal map since it is  just added on  top
JR: yes

NS: You can alse see that the bumps  Dizzi and  i have  are a bit like  pyramids that of couse depend on the  fall of  of the  brush one  use  how the  gray is converted into hight
JR: yes i couldn't find a brush that wasn't solid but i have them somewhere

NS: yes
JR: do we have time for a quick reminder of how to get this onto an SL object?

JR: getting kind of late

NS: yes  But  it  think we a re here
DS: save blend?

NS: If  you  fisrst can see the  effet of the bump map  on your  model  it is  super easy to make a new Normal map  Yes we can save So we  have all the  tools to add a  bumpmap  what ever in most convinient for the  situation I  used PS and Blender to do  it  and i  think i get more and more  fond of  using the  Draw on the  object directly  option for line and  doth and for  figures i am using  PS
JR: yes ... if i can get it to display on my iPad i would like that as well

NS: Yes
DS: loki sitting on me

NS: Smiles
DS: :

NS: Nice with  company  Dizzi
JR: how do we get this combined map out to make it available to SL?

NS: Then you have  to bake the  Normal map
DS: export the cube

DS: as you created a UV for it

DS: yes then bake normals

NS: Yes maybe  we should  do the  baking  after the  weekend
DS: yes

NS: because it is  a bit  confusing too
JR: yes or dizzi might help  me tomorrow

NS: Yes
DS: ok

DS: yes

NS: She know how  to  do
JR: anyway time for me to log
