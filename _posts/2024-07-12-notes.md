Summary notes from JR on a texturing session.

Working with some loose objects that will someday be joined to a single object for SL.

The object worked on, like some others, already has two elementary materials defined, named "Metal" and "Sponge". The object has seams between the two materials and is a deformed thickened cylinder. Here is the result of the work summarized here:

You can see the carbon fiber on the outside and part of the inside, and the dark gray other material called "Sponge".

Here, cleaned up, is what needed to be done to get that texturing:

* Add seams to the band, around the top edge ring before the beveling and the bottom edge right before beveling. This allows the unwrap function to produce a decent unwrap for the outward-facing surface, the only part that really matters.
