title: Blender Geometry Nodes #1 
---

* v0.1

Today we will do a small starting experiment with Geometry Nodes. I'll show what I do and explain what I can, and we'll note the things we do not yet understand for further experimentation and study. In today's starting exercise we will try to turn a mesh line into a circle. More or less.

Begin with a new blender file, with the standard cube. If you don't have a cube, create one. 

Select your cube and then select the geometry nodes layout at the top of the screen.

In the geometry panel at the bottom, click New. This adds a Geometry Nodes modifier to the cube. The screen now shows a "no-op" network, connecting geometry in with geometry out. I some magical way, the vertexes, edges, and faces of our input cube flow along the connection and, coming out the other end, they display in the scene.

If we disconnect the noodle (at least some people call the connections noodles), our cube will disappear from the scene. Disconnect it by dragging from the output end, just pulling the noodle off the connection. Your cube should disappear from the scene.

For practice pull a noodle from the input Geometry to the output and see that your cube appears again. Then pull the noodle away again: we are not going to use the cube at all. Doing this leaves the cube in our scene collection, but it has no geometry and will not display. I think we dare not remove it, because that will also remove what we are about to do.

There seem to be two basic ways of using geometry nodes. Sometimes you create an object in the scene and then modify it using nodes. Other times, you completely ignore the original object and create your own. That's what we're going to do now.

As with objects in the scene, we add geo nodes with Shift+A. If we type space immediately after that, we get a search field that is somewhat helpful in finding what we want. In this case we want to add a Mesh Line. I found that under Mesh / Primitives / Mesh Line After adding it, I hook the Mesh output of the line to the Geometry output, and our line appears:

Notice the Count field. That tells us how many verts the line has. We can't see them and in fact we can't really even edit our line, because, so far, the geometry nodes are in a modifier, so the thing in the scene isn't editable. If we were to apply our modifier, we'd have a "real" object and could further edit it. But that's not why we're here. We are here to convince this line that it is a circle, or at least as close to a circle as it can get.

What do we know about how to draw a circle? If we hearken back to our days in school, we may remember a couple of equations:

~~~
x squared plus y squared equals r squared
~~~

That one is probably familiar, the everyday Cartesian definition of a circle that you probably use almost every day. 

Perhaps less familiar is this one:

~~~
r = k
~~~

In polar coordinates, no matter what value the angle part (theta) takes on, the radius of the point at that angle is always k, the desired radius of the circle. We'll be using this idea, and also the two well-known (ha) definitions of x and y given a radius r and angle theta:

~~~
x = r * cos(theta)
y = r * sin(theta)
~~~
