JR: no but i wanted to wait until you were here :)

    Dizzi Sternberg: got to laka jump brb
NS: Smiles
NS: I am just rehersing ignore the "" text
NS: But one need to use a new language
NS: i will provide translations
NS: lol
    Dizzi Sternberg: yes there is no google translate
NS: no
NS: Smiles
NS: and Sl is a not toki pona land
    Dizzi Sternberg: no
NS: one group is all
    Dizzi Sternberg: so this logic problem
NS: Yes Dizzi ?
    Dizzi Sternberg: i realised i have done it before
NS: k
NS: so you are all set :)
    Dizzi Sternberg: Zen has the "Dizzi loop" on her railway
NS: ohh
NS: So nice Diziz you know that works
    Dizzi Sternberg: i just dont know how i did it
    Dizzi Sternberg: lol
NS: lol she got the script
NS: burt you have a stop
NS: and a s tart
NS: stop/start

NS: ok Dizzi

JR: oh no i have messed up my blender panes

NS: yes ?
NS: lucky whan one do janet it is only for the specific file one work on

JR: that's bad enough :)

NS: if you not deliberately save as default
NS: So what did you do
NS: lost a window
NS: or added to amny
NS: many

JR: i think i got it back. i was trying to make a split view, going to try to figure out some shader / texture / material


JR: i was thinking add a material and then open shader editor?

NS: yes
NS: in each window
NS: the icon inthe top left corner
NS: is the one defineing its mode
NS: so one can always go there and change
NS: and the splitting and joining is liek in excell basicly
    Dizzi Sternberg: back

JR: yes found that and figured out how to make the split go away. and i do not use excel :)

NS: ok
NS: bit hover over with the mouse
NS: and select the functin onthe border
NS: inthe start i tried toset up special windows which was suiting me better
NS: but over time i found that keeping the default system is much more consistent
NS: then change view mode (windows type)
NS: rather tan fiddelign with custom view setups

JR: yes probably


JR: hm i see that texture mapping is not intuitively obvious to the casual observer

NS: no
NS: that is a very complicated area
NS: I highly suggest you start to use the node system for that
NS: it is fast and very otent
NS: and put all functions into one window
NS: rather than a million of sun menus
NS: sub
NS: So you hve a model now Janet you are happy with ?

JR: not entirely but i think it is time to learn to do things like rivets

NS: Yes

JR: so i am starting with a cube :)

NS: let take the steps which is esential for building
NS: 1) do the model you like
NS: 2) Du the UV unwarpping and the UV mapping
NS: do
NS: 3) Setup textures
NS: So before you go to texturing
NS: you need to have a defined UV map
NS: is not you build sjoud be ina uniforn colour
NS: should be
NS: Sis you make unwrap of the model ?

JR: no, how do i do that?
JR: i though i should start by making a material for it?

NS: imagine you have a 3d obnject
NS: and whant to applu a paper sheet around it to make a texture
NS: it can be hard to fold a paper sheet around so it liik like no seams
NS: look

JR: yes i understand what unwrapping does. how do i trigger it?

NS: you go to uv edit
NS: the is a special window
NS: UV Editing
NS: and then when there
NS: select the object and go in edit mode

NS: then you can see all the build
NS: and if ti s a simple one
NS: you can select all points in edit mode
NS: yes
NS: but that is boenders default UV unwrap

NS: every object you add has a default uv setup
NS: may not neserarry work for what you liek to do

JR: let's say that where i want to get to is to put a line of rivets around all the faces of my cube ...

NS: yes

JR: so i probably want a bigger uv than it made?

NS: then you can get the actual UV map
NS: and use that as a guide to make all the bumps you need
NS: what material have you planned to use ?
NS: one for the metal ?

JR: i don't understand the question

NS: one for the other parts ?

JR: oh i'm not there yet, let's just texture a cube
JR: just to learn the basics

NS: the object may be made by different strucktures
NS: OK
NS: that is very easy
NS: because it i is by default uv unwrapped
NS: but if not you select all the point in it
NS: and press U

JR: ok

NS: that give you the different unwrap options
NS: and you just use Smart UV project
NS: which is the general form

NS: it cuts the object into adjoining faces
NS: so if you dont care how the texture wraps aroudn
NS: it is great method for most

JR: yes. i kind of remember that from before blender had these node things

NS: yes this is not nodes
NS: the same as pprevious

JR: but don't you use nodes to generate your rivets?

NS: now if you liek the moder to spli in certain parth
NS: You can do Janet
NS: use nodes for that
NS: but would take you a good week for that to get working
NS: normal we usea bumpmap
NS: todo those things
NS: just make dots in gray scale

JR: hm ok

NS: and they will apear as bumps inthe texture
NS: but let get the cube unwrapped
NS: say you like the lid
NS: and the bottom
NS: to be on their own
NS: coudl be wood planks
NS: and the the 4 sides

JR: yes i have it unwrapped in an 8x8 map
JR: like a cross in the center of the 8x8

NS: yes it is the standard
NS: but often you liek not to folow that
NS: so you need to be able to contrioll the unwrapping
NS: or add seams to the build
NS: where the unwarp splits

JR: so do i want to add seams at the top and bottom?

NS: yes just to lear you how to
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/af537608921d6eb79d0dc0802a71ac30](https://gyazo.com/af537608921d6eb79d0dc0802a71ac30)
NS: a box like this
NS: so seams are added by selecting edges
NS: and then go to edges / mark seams
NS: or alternatively
NS: Ctrl E / M

JR: ok i marked a seam at the top of the cube

NS: ok then try the botom

JR: ok did them both

JR: now do i unwrap it again?

NS: yes

JR: regular unwrap or smart?

NS: you get a little mnu when unvrapping a littl bar
NS: where one can controll features as distance between island
NS: of the unwrap

JR: when i regular unwrap made a mess

NS: but the two faces top and bottum should be independent now
NS: the sides will be a mesh probably

JR: yes a real messy one

NS: so add one seam line to one side of the box

JR: ah ok

NS: then it unwrap like a line with faces on
NS: a band

JR: ah ok and then i can use margin to space out the separate ones

NS: yes exactely
NS: and you can save that UV map
NS: and take it into PS
NS: and then add thign thereto you texture and they will be placed acording to the unwrap

JR: (which i do not have) but i suppose i could draw on it with procreate or something.
JR: in what form can it be saved? just as an image?

NS: in what ever format you draw program use
NS: blender expoers all types of textures
NS: export
NS: so formnat can be anything
NS: But that is the basic thing to do janet
NS: because as soon as yo make more difficult models - not bozes or cylinders
NS: you run into strange mapping of the textures

JR: yes

NS: In most cases . lats say one hae a metal build thing
NS: and one to do it quick and dirty
NS: one can just make the seams
NS: and select all the element with a specific material
NS: and unvrap the whole thing in one go
NS: and if oen has two materials
NS: do the same for the other

JR: yes

NS: OK so suposed you are happy with the unwrap
NS: time to see how textures look ar it

JR: ok yes

NS: now
NS: you have a texture you liek to use ????

JR: i can use any random one really

NS: yes
NS: so the easy one it just to use an image

JR: yes

NS: and wrap that to the box

JR: yes


JR: how do we do that

NS: Now we leave the UV editor
NS: and go to the Shading panel
NS: that is where we do texture setups
NS: you have 4 main panels there
NS: the model

JR: ok. because of whatever i did there, i have a Principled BSDF putting green on the model

NS: and to the left of it a directory
NS: yes it uses a default

JR: yes
JR: so somewhere in the folders i would find a texture?

NS: so the whole thign shoudl look liek this
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/934ad46dfeeeb326a711fc3bba5ef4c0](https://gyazo.com/934ad46dfeeeb326a711fc3bba5ef4c0)

NS: now find the texture to use
NS: and upload that

JR: into SL you mean?

NS: If you have one in SL you need to download it
NS: you need to find a local texture in your computer to use

JR: i have a texture on my desktop, what should i do with it?
JR: i see it in the directory window

NS: yes under that
NS: there is a texture display window
NS: and you need the texture to apear int hat
NS: you see 3 lines
NS: inthe top row of the window
NS: has a option for uploading a texture

JR: The one that says View New Open?

NS: yes
NS: Inage open
NS: next to it

JR: in the lower left panel?

JR: not the directory one?

NS: Ok there is an other way
NS: much easier
NS: use the directory folder
NS: to find you texture
NS: click and drag to the window below

JR: ok tried both. anyway now i have the image

NS: Good
NS: So you get an immage
NS: next
NS: you need a material
NS: and you have that green stuff
NS: you can use in the panel to the (far) right

JR: yes the principled BSDF thing

NS: yes
NS: so that control pannel is the most confusing thing in blender
NS: on the left side there si a lot of icons

JR: :) i agree so far :)

NS: each with different content
NS: so you of course need to be in some window doing textures material
NS: which is some red circle with a map on

JR: i don't see any icons on my screen or your last picture

NS: yes you doo a lttle (vertical) row of icons

JR: oh you mean the panel on the far right?

NS: yes
NS: in the left side of that

JR: yes and pick the map one?

NS: there is a vertical row of icons
NS: and you picj the one wich is a red circles with somethign on "maybe a sphere"

JR: yes i think it is a map :)

NS: So it look like my picture
NS: yes
NS: so that is where one controls textures
NS: Now to associcate the image with the shader

JR: ok

NS: under the center window there is the node window

JR: yes

NS: and you have the principled shader set up
NS: but you need a texture
NS: so you need a node
NS: to grab the texture and use that as colours
NS: So in the top menu you dinf
NS: ADD / texture / Image texture
NS: shoudl add a texture node

JR: yes done

NS: in the little box
NS: defining the texture
NS: there is a place called new open

JR: yes

NS: and a funny icon in front
NS: the little icon in front
NS: is used to select already uploaded texturee

JR: ah yes picked the one from the list

NS: so click that
NS: you get a lit of textures you  added
NS: list
NS: and you select the one to use

JR: and i wire color into base color and there it is

NS: exactly
NS: and you box should be textured

JR: now when i export that to DAE will it retain that texture?

NS: no
NS: DAE is erratic with textures
NS: it should be posible but I've never had it work
NS: So one upload the box as DEA no textures

JR: again in SL

NS: and the textures you used after
NS: and then texture it is SL

JR: so given this texture can i see it on the uv and then adjust where the wrapping is?

NS: yes
NS: we go back to the UV thing
NS: uv editing
NS: Here's a picture:
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/e62b473e305d1ef7369a927b2d9d5fce](https://gyazo.com/e62b473e305d1ef7369a927b2d9d5fce)
NS: here i am back in my box a bit more complex
NS: i have it is edit mode and selected all the faces on the top
NS: and inthe right panel you see the UV MAP
NS: and i selected an image that wasused to texture
NS: now i can decide whare i like my uv map to be
NS: maybe i like the top of the boxx to have the whole map
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/3c0715c29431c5461afb61fb63f0e3a7](https://gyazo.com/3c0715c29431c5461afb61fb63f0e3a7)
NS: like this
NS: and i can get my texture displayed as i like
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/58eb1c9288226b7f72b39b4ea8f4e726](https://gyazo.com/58eb1c9288226b7f72b39b4ea8f4e726)
NS: So if you have a special texture with things you want to diplay
NS: you can fiddle the uv map around
NS: to cover those areas

JR: Needed to set the  view to see rendered view here ?

NS: so you need to display it differently
NS: yes you have those setttign fo mesh and faces and textures
NS: so need the textures to see those

JR: ok so i can drag the uv things around to line up with my input texture
JR: and then when i export ... and put that texture on that material ... voila

NS: yes
NS: then you can export the model
NS: and the texture
NS: and when you add the texture in SL
NS: all should be perfectly aligned

JR: yes. what was interesting is the SL showed the texture ... but did not load it

NS: no

JR: so if there were separate materials they would be faces in SL?

NS: one needs to get it separately
NS: or you can try to add the texture uplaod with the model there is an option
NS: but i have very bad experiences with that

JR: yes i tried and it is in the DAE but still doesn't come in to SL

NS: No

JR: can you sketch for me the procedure for doing a bump map? or is this enough for one day. i've used up your whole day so far.

NS: the bump map is a gray map
NS: black is low white is up
NS: so we can do a simple thign to get you started Janet

JR: ok
JR: just a bump or crease or something simple

NS: Ok the bump map shoudl start out as a uniform gray colour 0.5, 0.5 0.5 RGB
NS: So the process is to make a picture that can act as a bump map
NS: we can do that in blender

JR: yes

NS: First let is go to the texture paint mode
NS: the panels call textures paint
NS: the view is calld texture paint

JR: ok yes

NS: ![https://gyazo.com/b51993563144c3ba47c78f823e13f6e3](https://gyazo.com/b51993563144c3ba47c78f823e13f6e3)

JR: that still has my janet picture in it

NS: look like this for me

JR: yes exactly

NS: the first thing we need
NS: is a new picture
NS: in the left panel
NS: there is a Image menu
NS: So Image / New
NS: and you get a new picture you can name and save
NS: shoild be all black

NS: you can name it in the bar in the menu line
NS: say bump map
NS: "Bump Map"

NS: OK we like some bumps
NS: on the model
NS: so you draw a few white lines across the black image
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/97e420fb7b27b350dc319b24ad0fe44c](https://gyazo.com/97e420fb7b27b350dc319b24ad0fe44c)
NS: like this or anything

NS: then we have created the basis for a bump map
NS: but we cant see it on our model
NS: So we need to accociate
NS: the bump map immage
NS: with the texture nodes
NS: for it to display

NS: So we go back to Shading
NS: and you add a new node

NS: from the node menu
NS: no it is a bump node and a texture
NS: So first the texture
NS: add one new
NS: and associate it with the bump map

JR: confused. do i add a texture node and put the bump map into it?

NS: No you first add the texture
NS: it is one node
NS: then you add a bump node
NS: ADD( VECTOR /BUMP

JR: add image texture? i am not clear on how to add the image we just drew.

NS: ![https://gyazo.com/d59b8bafc91b5107b4192819a51fd059](https://gyazo.com/d59b8bafc91b5107b4192819a51fd059)
NS: like this
NS: you can see int he texture nose
NS: node
NS: ther si that little icon tos eelect textures in fron of the name field
NS: so lick that and select the texture

JR: i am behind. is the europe thing an image texture node?

NS: no in the node editor window
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/a686620080b4f8574f9e2c13be0b3a2d](https://gyazo.com/a686620080b4f8574f9e2c13be0b3a2d)
NS: like this Janet

JR: ok i do not know how to get those two new nodes in
JR: what did you add?

NS: first i added a additional texture node
NS: then i added a BUm node
NS: then i associated the texture node with the bump texture

JR: ok add vector bump

NS: yes
NS: so you have two new nodes
NS: and then the texture node
NS: need to be associated with the bump map picture you made
NS: so set the name to that
NS: clicking the little icon in front of the name field and select the texture from the list

JR: ok got it

NS: ok now we like to test
NS: so drag the colour
NS: fromt he new texture node to the BSDF shader
NS: you shoudl display the bump picture
NS: on your model

JR: yes

NS: ![https://gyazo.com/c6f31b4b4132d8ac04411179964c0f89](https://gyazo.com/c6f31b4b4132d8ac04411179964c0f89)
NS: like this
NS: so you are use you got th right texture

JR: yes right

NS: but you like to make it into a bump thing

JR: so wire it to height?

NS: so we drag the texture through a converter
NS: and then from the ourput of the bump normal
NS: to shader normal
NS: and restore the  colour to the original picture
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/7c6fe382cb76d36a6f478017deedab8b](https://gyazo.com/7c6fe382cb76d36a6f478017deedab8b)
NS: so i got this

JR: mine looks mostl like a dark smear across the picture

NS: can i see
NS: your setup
NS: a screen dump

JR: ![https://gyazo.com/6651dcfb444e0abe5de9fa930e2938ca](https://gyazo.com/6651dcfb444e0abe5de9fa930e2938ca)
JR: i think it's probably right just looks weird because of my weird image

NS: yes ok janet
NS: it of course depends on the bump map but it is ok

JR: with a sensible texture it would look better.

NS: depends on how the lgiht falls
NS: how steep the side are
NS: if you make like total black and white
NS: it will not work so well
NS: it is best for gradual changes in surface
NS: but that is tha very basic setup
NS: Now
NS: thing can get nicer
NS: there is a little trick in Blender
NS: you go to the node window
NS: and click in the node with the bump map
NS: so it get highlighted
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/ed525bdc75a91870a7bd3ad69b7c2eea](https://gyazo.com/ed525bdc75a91870a7bd3ad69b7c2eea)
NS: then return to texture paint
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/85a0b995f6f9486a8e17328e93f4d9e8](https://gyazo.com/85a0b995f6f9486a8e17328e93f4d9e8)
NS: and you should have this pocture
NS: where the bumpmap is displayed on your model
NS: and then you can draw dirextly on you model
NS: and it will be reflected in your immage

JR: ah yes i see :)

NS: ![https://gyazo.com/80a2bdcf112e6621a1e475953e8ecc22](https://gyazo.com/80a2bdcf112e6621a1e475953e8ecc22)

JR: white is up black is down?

NS: like this
NS: yes
NS: and then one can use all the paint system in blender to shape things
NS: make grooves and lines and whatever
NS: place dots as bumps
NS: engrave with a gray colour and so on
NS: but you get an idear of how the bump are placed

JR: it seems like it draws with a hole in the brush

NS: ok
NS: so maybe you have a fun brush
NS: to go through the option of drawing in blender it a study in itself
NS: basically it can do anythign Photoshop can do and more

JR: ![https://gyazo.com/b39085ce6e82c92f389a045f2005aac8](https://gyazo.com/b39085ce6e82c92f389a045f2005aac8)

NS: but it is much much more complicated
NS: ok the whole
NS: is the white top
NS: you draw a white line on a black background
NS: white will be all flat
NS: max height
NS: therefor a real bumpmap

JR: but see how there are two lines there? I just drew the one shape

NS: is starting out as a gray scale image
NS: set to neutral 0.5 gray

JR: and it's kind of a double image

NS: because you see reflections
NS: and shadows
NS: and it all depends on how light affect the surface
NS: if you have light from you wiespoint you willsee nothng
NS: no shadow
NS: so restrich yo bum to within
NS: the gray scale

JR: In this picture ... ![https://gyazo.com/da68ac53eceb9a4a3a4c4ec9935434c9](https://gyazo.com/da68ac53eceb9a4a3a4c4ec9935434c9) I just drew one black line over neutral gray
JR: but there are two lines on the image. i do not understand why.

NS: yes
    Dizzi Sternberg: thats the 3d veiw
NS: it has to do with image resolution
NS: and is a 3 D view
    Dizzi Sternberg: so it looks like emkbossing
NS: find a softer brush
NS: and a bigger line
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/7c7842c4e83b543c91c63b363dc02ae3](https://gyazo.com/7c7842c4e83b543c91c63b363dc02ae3)
NS: the same in my example

JR: ok. how do i get a "softer brush"?

NS: ![https://gyazo.com/9876b4fb9f9b3ab38e6da1c2b97ef59f](https://gyazo.com/9876b4fb9f9b3ab38e6da1c2b97ef59f)

JR: oh i just have one, i think: texdraw

NS: there is a huge system to set up brishes
NS: with thise menu headlines

JR: ah wonderful :)
JR: i suppose it can import .brush files or some such?

NS: yes that is possible too
NS: but the best you can do
NS: is simply not use white
NS: use a shade fo gray
NS: and then so to fall off
NS: and select the fall off aroudn the brush

JR: yes. oh before i pass out ... how did you make that round one on your example

NS: was just here Janet
NS: i did not select anything special for this example

JR: so that is just a single dot?
JR: ah yes i see

NS: yes

JR: well i have more than enough to start me off. this was very kind of you to walk me through all this

NS: just a single dot
NS: and you can set dot spacing

JR: thank you very much :)

NS: and make them run at a line
NS: and all kind of things
NS: So the last thing we need
NS: before ending today
NS: is how on earth does one use that in SL
NS: Because we have Normal Maps here
NS: no bump maps
NS: So we are in some small troubles
NS: So we need to convert the bump to a normal map
NS: Lucky the node system support that too
NS: So lets go back to the SHADING panels
NS: and add a new texture to the system of nodes

JR: ok

NS: i add a stand alone Immage texture node
NS: ![https://gyazo.com/3dbc1df0d9867d6fbc3ccbeff2c8b4df](https://gyazo.com/3dbc1df0d9867d6fbc3ccbeff2c8b4df)
NS: like this

JR: ok

NS: if i press new
NS: in the texture node
NS: i can make a new immage

JR: yes. blank?

NS: ![https://gyazo.com/1b086690bb289a97abfbbc36a2135ade](https://gyazo.com/1b086690bb289a97abfbbc36a2135ade)
NS: call it maybe normal map
NS: you can rename it anytime
NS: should ba ablank black inage

JR: and alpha on

NS: alfa off
NS: only 3 channels
NS: rgb
NS: you can display it in the picture display panel
NS: by findign it si the list
NS: see it is a black square

JR: wait please
JR: your picture showed alpha on

NS: Yes doesn't matter
NS: THe real thign is alfa off
NS: Normal map dont have alfa channels

JR: ok so anyway i get a black thing by opening the normal map on the left

NS: you got ti janet ?

JR: i think so

NS: super
NS: So next thing is to bake a normal map from what we have
NS: the material node system we created

JR: aiee. ok. ready. :)

NS: So go to the node panel
NS: ensure the Normal map texture is highlighted
NS: then go to the RIGHT side panel

JR: yes

NS: ![https://gyazo.com/356757e975f99b48e9ce42e95bcae37c](https://gyazo.com/356757e975f99b48e9ce42e95bcae37c)
NS: go to the near top
NS: and click the render icon
NS: and select the render mode to cycles

NS: now scroll down tot he bottom of the panel
NS: you find a entry called bake


NS: ![https://gyazo.com/544fa82faec8cf7965107102d70223c7](https://gyazo.com/544fa82faec8cf7965107102d70223c7)
NS: looks like this when opened

NS: you have to change the bake type
