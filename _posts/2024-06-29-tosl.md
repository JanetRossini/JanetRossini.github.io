[2024/06/29 10:43]  Dizzi Sternberg: so yes the last bit of the puzzle last night was getting into SL
[2024/06/29 10:43]  Dizzi Sternberg: i can do that i think
[2024/06/29 10:43]  Dizzi Sternberg: if you want to try
[2024/06/29 10:44]  Janet Rossini: sure let's, i want to see what this new texture i made looks like
[2024/06/29 10:44]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 10:44]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok open the blend file
[2024/06/29 10:44]  Janet Rossini: yes i am in the shading layout
[2024/06/29 10:44]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 10:45]  Janet Rossini: i should think one could "just" wire the normals to some kind of output thing
[2024/06/29 10:45]  Dizzi Sternberg: on the menu at top select World
[2024/06/29 10:45]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes thats what we will do
[2024/06/29 10:46]  Janet Rossini: World??
[2024/06/29 10:46]  Janet Rossini: in blender?
[2024/06/29 10:46]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/351a75f6686c1e7c8f5a7b3db0c3d408
[2024/06/29 10:46]  Dizzi Sternberg: top left of node window
[2024/06/29 10:47]  Dizzi Sternberg: there is Object, world, linestyle
[2024/06/29 10:47]  Dizzi Sternberg: select world
[2024/06/29 10:47]  Janet Rossini: yes found it
[2024/06/29 10:48]  Dizzi Sternberg: we are going to set up a simple backgrond illumination
[2024/06/29 10:48]  Janet Rossini: hm ok
[2024/06/29 10:48]  Dizzi Sternberg: you should have two of these https://gyazo.com/ce1f44fae266618da529ce2c55682914
[2024/06/29 10:48]  Janet Rossini: i have nothing
[2024/06/29 10:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: mm
[2024/06/29 10:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/f62622f47df3c4f86eb09303f40553f1
[2024/06/29 10:49]  Janet Rossini: they were hiding. there must be some keystroke to bring it into view. i have two things not three
[2024/06/29 10:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 10:50]  Dizzi Sternberg: we need to add the HUe/stat its a colour node
[2024/06/29 10:51]  Janet Rossini: ok added and hooked up
[2024/06/29 10:51]  Dizzi Sternberg: wire it like this https://gyazo.com/b52bc36428e73deb7560e913aeaaf933
[2024/06/29 10:51]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 10:51]  Dizzi Sternberg: so go back to object veiw
[2024/06/29 10:52]  Dizzi Sternberg: on the node window
[2024/06/29 10:52]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 10:53]  Dizzi Sternberg: we are going to add two image textures as output
[2024/06/29 10:53]  Janet Rossini: ok
[2024/06/29 10:53]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/1f7625dd02e0d06623e1eac2b76b7578
[2024/06/29 10:54]  Dizzi Sternberg: create two textures as 1k x 1k and name then texture and bump
[2024/06/29 10:54]  Dizzi Sternberg: using new on the selector
[2024/06/29 10:55]  Janet Rossini: whoa
[2024/06/29 10:55]  Dizzi Sternberg: they dont connect to anything
[2024/06/29 10:55]  Janet Rossini: wait for yes please
[2024/06/29 10:56]  Janet Rossini: how did you name them
[2024/06/29 10:56]  Dizzi Sternberg: dooulbe clicked on the untitled name
[2024/06/29 10:56]  Janet Rossini: the nodes
[2024/06/29 10:56]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 10:57]  Janet Rossini: where is this untitled name of which you speak
[2024/06/29 10:57]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok let me screeshot it
[2024/06/29 10:58]  Dizzi Sternberg: when you click new on the node it looks like this https://gyazo.com/dd66730349d9162b4fa0b71b835bcd06
[2024/06/29 10:58]  Janet Rossini: yeah. alpha or no alpha?
[2024/06/29 10:59]  Dizzi Sternberg: none
[2024/06/29 10:59]  Janet Rossini: yours is checked
[2024/06/29 10:59]  Dizzi Sternberg: doesnt really matter
[2024/06/29 11:00]  Janet Rossini: should color space be sRGB or none?
[2024/06/29 11:01]  Dizzi Sternberg: may need to set alpha to none in SL if you do
[2024/06/29 11:01]  Dizzi Sternberg: sRGB i think
[2024/06/29 11:01]  Janet Rossini: hm ok i guess i have the two things there then
[2024/06/29 11:01]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 11:03]  Dizzi Sternberg: so in the top right menu theres a drop down beside the last circle called "shading"
[2024/06/29 11:03]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:03]  Dizzi Sternberg: select scene world
[2024/06/29 11:04]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:04]  Janet Rossini: new view
[2024/06/29 11:04]  Dizzi Sternberg: so then the background is white https://gyazo.com/f28ca8510c1055484452c4d894d1cf40
[2024/06/29 11:04]  Janet Rossini: yes whiteish
[2024/06/29 11:04]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:05]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 11:05]  Janet Rossini: hue 1.8 i suppose, whatever that is
[2024/06/29 11:05]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:05]  Dizzi Sternberg: its really just a white light that illuminates from all sides
[2024/06/29 11:06]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:06]  Dizzi Sternberg: the next thing if find the renedr tab
[2024/06/29 11:06]  Janet Rossini: the one with cycles / eveee
[2024/06/29 11:06]  Dizzi Sternberg: and open it
[2024/06/29 11:07]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:07]  Janet Rossini: ok yes
[2024/06/29 11:07]  Dizzi Sternberg: make sure you are in cycles
[2024/06/29 11:07]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:07]  Dizzi Sternberg: i use the GPU but you can use CPU too
[2024/06/29 11:08]  Janet Rossini: yes they cannot use my GPU they are too stupid
[2024/06/29 11:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: so CPU
[2024/06/29 11:08]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 11:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: now we are going to bake the colour texture fist
[2024/06/29 11:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: first
[2024/06/29 11:08]  Janet Rossini: ok
[2024/06/29 11:09]  Dizzi Sternberg: select the cube and also select the texture output node
[2024/06/29 11:09]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/7eec39f602070180808f299dcd88af10
[2024/06/29 11:09]  Janet Rossini: ok i guess
[2024/06/29 11:09]  Dizzi Sternberg: you need both or it will error and say not selected
[2024/06/29 11:10]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:10]  Eye of Odin HUD to wear: + Helen Haines (HelenHaines)  [3]
[2024/06/29 11:10]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok in the render tab open bake https://gyazo.com/a500f569189d9a4063739e713ba5f1d5
[2024/06/29 11:10]  Dizzi Sternberg: and set combined
[2024/06/29 11:11]  Eye of Odin HUD to wear: - Helen Haines (HelenHaines)  [2]
[2024/06/29 11:11]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:11]  Dizzi Sternberg: now hit bake
[2024/06/29 11:11]  Dizzi Sternberg: your fans will run
[2024/06/29 11:12]  Dizzi Sternberg: as it renders the texture for the object
[2024/06/29 11:12]  Janet Rossini: i have no fans. done
[2024/06/29 11:12]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 11:12]  Janet Rossini: and it appeared on the left
[2024/06/29 11:12]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/27a3b03532a9b46720377b39b43c353b
[2024/06/29 11:12]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: looks like that?
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: greate
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Janet Rossini: looks okish
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: -e
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes should see the scratches etc
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Janet Rossini: has all the shapes on it
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Janet Rossini: just drawn on of course
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 11:13]  Janet Rossini: i imagine i want to save this somehow?
[2024/06/29 11:14]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:14]  Dizzi Sternberg: hambuger image/save as
[2024/06/29 11:15]  Dizzi Sternberg: i usually use TGA
[2024/06/29 11:15]  Dizzi Sternberg: but PNG or Jpg is ok
[2024/06/29 11:15]  Janet Rossini: used PNG. done
[2024/06/29 11:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: now select the lower output node https://gyazo.com/7ab851dd1e8096242a2c0280e478092b
[2024/06/29 11:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: the bump
[2024/06/29 11:16]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: and select Normal in the bake window
[2024/06/29 11:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/02a0a3c1534ffc4656f656eca13c0983
[2024/06/29 11:17]  Janet Rossini: ok
[2024/06/29 11:17]  Dizzi Sternberg: hit bake
[2024/06/29 11:17]  Dizzi Sternberg: should get this
[2024/06/29 11:17]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/b0d197f8c451ec0c0e7cdc59778fabde
[2024/06/29 11:18]  Janet Rossini: yes. save that?
[2024/06/29 11:18]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:18]  Dizzi Sternberg: so the last thing we need is to export the cube
[2024/06/29 11:19]  Dizzi Sternberg: as a DAe
[2024/06/29 11:19]  Janet Rossini: hm ok
[2024/06/29 11:19]  Dizzi Sternberg: because we modified the cube with a different UV
[2024/06/29 11:20]  Dizzi Sternberg: we need to use that cube
[2024/06/29 11:20]  Janet Rossini: the unwrap?
[2024/06/29 11:20]  Dizzi Sternberg: not a standard
[2024/06/29 11:20]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:20]  Janet Rossini: so now i just build it?
[2024/06/29 11:21]  Dizzi Sternberg: we want the cubes mesh with the unwraps we made
[2024/06/29 11:21]  Janet Rossini: so upload all three and apply?
[2024/06/29 11:21]  Dizzi Sternberg: just upload the mesh as a collada
[2024/06/29 11:21]  Dizzi Sternberg: and bring into SL
[2024/06/29 11:22]  Dizzi Sternberg: 2m cube
[2024/06/29 11:22]  Dizzi Sternberg: :)
[2024/06/29 11:22]  Janet Rossini: f'g 2 meter cubes
[2024/06/29 11:23]  Dizzi Sternberg: so now just put the texture and bump into the cube
[2024/06/29 11:23]  Janet Rossini: don't i have to upload them first?
[2024/06/29 11:23]  Dizzi Sternberg: so youll need to bring them in
[2024/06/29 11:23]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:24]  Janet Rossini: ok got em
[2024/06/29 11:24]  Dizzi Sternberg: so we can do it as none PCR first
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Dizzi Sternberg: load the texture and bumpiness
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Janet Rossini: ?
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Dizzi Sternberg: edit cube
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Dizzi Sternberg: tesxture
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Janet Rossini: in the edit ok
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Janet Rossini: not PBR?
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Janet Rossini: BlinnPhong?
[2024/06/29 11:25]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:26]  Dizzi Sternberg: we can then make a PBR too
[2024/06/29 11:26]  Dizzi Sternberg: same files
[2024/06/29 11:26]  Janet Rossini: so diffuse gets the regular texture?
[2024/06/29 11:26]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:26]  Janet Rossini: hm drag works that's nice
[2024/06/29 11:27]  Dizzi Sternberg: then bump into bumpiness
[2024/06/29 11:29]  Dizzi Sternberg: mm
[2024/06/29 11:29]  Janet Rossini: ok so that worked as expected
[2024/06/29 11:29]  Janet Rossini: looks ok to you?
[2024/06/29 11:29]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:30]  Dizzi Sternberg: i gave it a little shinyness
[2024/06/29 11:30]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/0c6ed5dadf6234309a23bed0193f94be
[2024/06/29 11:30]  Janet Rossini: interesting fact: the numbers there are the S values on the gray scale i drew with
[2024/06/29 11:30]  Dizzi Sternberg: then the embosing stands out
[2024/06/29 11:30]  Janet Rossini: seem to have no effect on the depth
[2024/06/29 11:31]  Dizzi Sternberg: no
[2024/06/29 11:31]  Dizzi Sternberg: that seems to have worked fine
[2024/06/29 11:31]  Janet Rossini: also those flat panels on the one side with the rivet things?
[2024/06/29 11:32]  Janet Rossini: those were gradients. i was kind of expecting a wedge shape but got that
[2024/06/29 11:32]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok
[2024/06/29 11:32]  Janet Rossini: the other stuff worked nicely tho
[2024/06/29 11:32]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:32]  Dizzi Sternberg: so now you can make a PBR material
[2024/06/29 11:33]  Dizzi Sternberg: using the two textures
[2024/06/29 11:33]  Dizzi Sternberg: and copy that cube and aplly it
[2024/06/29 11:34]  Janet Rossini: i'm not clear where the textures go in PBR
[2024/06/29 11:34]  Dizzi Sternberg: ns told us
[2024/06/29 11:34]  Dizzi Sternberg: one sec
[2024/06/29 11:34]  Janet Rossini: it is showing me 5 squares
[2024/06/29 11:35]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok i get 4?
[2024/06/29 11:35]  Dizzi Sternberg: texture goes in base color
[2024/06/29 11:36]  Dizzi Sternberg: bump goes in normal
[2024/06/29 11:36]  Janet Rossini: i tried dragging texture into base color and nothing happened
[2024/06/29 11:36]  Dizzi Sternberg: and a blank texture in Metalic
[2024/06/29 11:37]  Dizzi Sternberg: have you created a new material?
[2024/06/29 11:37]  Janet Rossini: only if someone told me to
[2024/06/29 11:37]  Dizzi Sternberg: Dizzi Sternberg: so now you can make a PBR material
 Dizzi Sternberg: using the two textures
[2024/06/29 11:37]  Dizzi Sternberg: so material folder
[2024/06/29 11:38]  Janet Rossini: oh that
[2024/06/29 11:38]  Dizzi Sternberg: make new materail
[2024/06/29 11:38]  Dizzi Sternberg: create new
[2024/06/29 11:38]  Janet Rossini: and drag those guys in or ?
[2024/06/29 11:38]  Dizzi Sternberg: hees one i made for leather https://gyazo.com/dd7739e9fe54e89ea0e93d2a77009b07
[2024/06/29 11:39]  Dizzi Sternberg: base colour is the texture, normal is the bump
[2024/06/29 11:39]  Dizzi Sternberg: metalic just create a blank texture
[2024/06/29 11:40]  Janet Rossini: ok i think i did it
[2024/06/29 11:40]  Dizzi Sternberg: emmisive leave
[2024/06/29 11:40]  Janet Rossini: didn't change when i set blank on metallic
[2024/06/29 11:40]  Dizzi Sternberg: so its metal so set to 1.000 in metalic
[2024/06/29 11:40]  Janet Rossini: probably ok
[2024/06/29 11:41]  Dizzi Sternberg: and rougness 0.3
[2024/06/29 11:41]  Dizzi Sternberg: then save
[2024/06/29 11:41]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 11:41]  Janet Rossini: now i can just slam that onto the white cube?
[2024/06/29 11:42]  Dizzi Sternberg: then drag it to a face
[2024/06/29 11:42]  Dizzi Sternberg: bosh
[2024/06/29 11:42]  Janet Rossini: i love that dent
[2024/06/29 11:42]  Dizzi Sternberg: hehe
[2024/06/29 11:42]  Janet Rossini: not sure how i did that
[2024/06/29 11:43]  Dizzi Sternberg: i think that works :)
[2024/06/29 11:43]  Janet Rossini: yes, thank you
[2024/06/29 11:43]  Dizzi Sternberg: far better than the other cube
[2024/06/29 11:43]  Janet Rossini: i almost know how to do it
[2024/06/29 11:43]  Janet Rossini: yes it is, even in my weak sauce viewer
[2024/06/29 11:44]  Eye of Odin HUD to wear: + dullahan·host.exe (BonnieBelle94)  [3]
[2024/06/29 11:44]  Eye of Odin HUD to wear: - dullahan·host.exe (BonnieBelle94)  [2]
[2024/06/29 11:44]  Dizzi Sternberg: now you can get more complex with the nodes like adding in a logo onto the texture as a separate image then baking all together
[2024/06/29 11:45]  Janet Rossini: yes clearly one can stack them sim to the two we have
[2024/06/29 11:45]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:45]  Dizzi Sternberg: now NS only has one output
[2024/06/29 11:45]  Janet Rossini: now the limits are back to my inherently weak artistic ability :)
[2024/06/29 11:46]  Dizzi Sternberg: but i prefer making the outputs into separate images so they dont overwrite
[2024/06/29 11:47]  Dizzi Sternberg: but you can bake all and save then bake normal then save
[2024/06/29 11:47]  Janet Rossini: oh somehow she baked out just one file?
[2024/06/29 11:47]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:47]  Janet Rossini: oh you mean she till saved two but didn't make a new image
[2024/06/29 11:47]  Janet Rossini: still*
[2024/06/29 11:47]  Dizzi Sternberg: i just discovered that way this afternoon
[2024/06/29 11:47]  Dizzi Sternberg: thats right
[2024/06/29 11:48]  Janet Rossini: baked to X saved X backed normal to X saved again
[2024/06/29 11:48]  Janet Rossini: we baked to X and Y
[2024/06/29 11:48]  Janet Rossini: this is better IMO
[2024/06/29 11:48]  Dizzi Sternberg: this way it will prompt you to save both if you exit
[2024/06/29 11:48]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:48]  Dizzi Sternberg: its simpler for my brain
[2024/06/29 11:48]  Dizzi Sternberg: :)
[2024/06/29 11:49]  Janet Rossini: yes thanks, i nearly know how to do it
[2024/06/29 11:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: :)
[2024/06/29 11:49]  Dizzi Sternberg: its very powerful isnt it
[2024/06/29 11:50]  Janet Rossini: it is. and it's kind of like assembler or something. no way to just do what you want, you build it up out of 19 tiny unit operations
[2024/06/29 11:50]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:50]  Janet Rossini: i suppose, however, one could build an add-on
[2024/06/29 11:50]  Dizzi Sternberg: but then you can save node trees
[2024/06/29 11:51]  Dizzi Sternberg: of combine into a black box
[2024/06/29 11:51]  Janet Rossini: yes i suppose you can and then bring them in and edit
[2024/06/29 11:51]  Janet Rossini: yes interesting idea
[2024/06/29 11:51]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 11:52]  Dizzi Sternberg: NS made me a node tree for shiny metal and i just cut and pasted that for all the garrat
[2024/06/29 11:52]  Janet Rossini: i'll brb, short break
[2024/06/29 11:52]  Dizzi Sternberg: ok inn loo
[2024/06/29 11:52]  Dizzi Sternberg: ill
[2024/06/29 11:59]  Janet Rossini: back
[2024/06/29 11:59]  Dizzi Sternberg: wb
[2024/06/29 12:00]  Janet Rossini: t
[2024/06/29 12:00]  Dizzi Sternberg: i just added this https://gyazo.com/f52e0291ea7f8c3f029bb7cbfb67f0b7
[2024/06/29 12:00]  Dizzi Sternberg: https://gyazo.com/6f5dfc1cd5997d2d6e192ecc04b85164 gives a mix
[2024/06/29 12:01]  Janet Rossini: can't really read the gyazo but ok
[2024/06/29 12:01]  Dizzi Sternberg: added in the logos
[2024/06/29 12:01]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 12:02]  Dizzi Sternberg: so there are other tricks NS uses
[2024/06/29 12:02]  Dizzi Sternberg: like adding a bevel to edges
[2024/06/29 12:02]  Janet Rossini: with texture?
[2024/06/29 12:02]  Dizzi Sternberg: no she calculates it in nodes
[2024/06/29 12:03]  Janet Rossini: in the model side
[2024/06/29 12:03]  Dizzi Sternberg: and mixes it into the normals
[2024/06/29 12:03]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:03]  Janet Rossini: hm, no not if she's mixing it. i guess i'd have to see the network
[2024/06/29 12:03]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:04]  Dizzi Sternberg: the nextwork is using the mesh to determine the edges neading to bevel
[2024/06/29 12:04]  Dizzi Sternberg: needing
[2024/06/29 12:04]  Dizzi Sternberg: is nice for stuff like the crankshafts
[2024/06/29 12:05]  Janet Rossini: be nice to have a library of networks
[2024/06/29 12:05]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:05]  Janet Rossini: i just ate a piece of leftover prime rib and think i may regret it
[2024/06/29 12:05]  Dizzi Sternberg: aww
[2024/06/29 12:06]  Janet Rossini: probably won't kill me but fridge isn't as cold as it might be
[2024/06/29 12:06]  Dizzi Sternberg: no
[2024/06/29 12:06]  Janet Rossini: oh if i don't show up tuesday i'm probably dealing with installers. no telling what time they'll come.
[2024/06/29 12:06]  Dizzi Sternberg: so when is new fridge coming?
[2024/06/29 12:06]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:07]  Dizzi Sternberg: a week on tuesday ill be out until late
[2024/06/29 12:07]  Janet Rossini: i am hopeful that it'll go smoothly
[2024/06/29 12:07]  Janet Rossini: ah?
[2024/06/29 12:07]  Dizzi Sternberg: theres a "meet the examiner" meeting in York at 730pm
[2024/06/29 12:08]  Janet Rossini: what does the examiner examine?
[2024/06/29 12:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: and its 30 mins away
[2024/06/29 12:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: IAM
[2024/06/29 12:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: the things im learning
[2024/06/29 12:08]  Dizzi Sternberg: sooner or later they test you
[2024/06/29 12:09]  Dizzi Sternberg: and you get the Intitute of Advanced Motorists test cert
[2024/06/29 12:09]  Dizzi Sternberg: useful for insurance companies
[2024/06/29 12:10]  Janet Rossini: ah cool :)
[2024/06/29 12:10]  Janet Rossini: so you get a few exams along the way?
[2024/06/29 12:10]  Dizzi Sternberg: apparently you can do a masters too
[2024/06/29 12:10]  Dizzi Sternberg: its continual assesment
[2024/06/29 12:10]  Dizzi Sternberg: and when you are ready they say do the test
[2024/06/29 12:11]  Janet Rossini: ah
[2024/06/29 12:11]  Dizzi Sternberg: but you have to do stuff to a good sdtandard
[2024/06/29 12:11]  Dizzi Sternberg: so i will have to improve my braking
[2024/06/29 12:11]  Dizzi Sternberg: i brake to early
[2024/06/29 12:12]  Dizzi Sternberg: so i need to stop at yeild lines more exactly
[2024/06/29 12:12]  Janet Rossini: maybe find an empty parking lot and practice a bunch
[2024/06/29 12:12]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:12]  Dizzi Sternberg: he told me a trick that helped
[2024/06/29 12:13]  Janet Rossini: close eyes and scream SCREEEEE?
[2024/06/29 12:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: on the way back from the cattery i had to emerge from a blind sideroad
[2024/06/29 12:13]  Dizzi Sternberg: i managed that without halting
[2024/06/29 12:14]  Dizzi Sternberg: since all was clear
[2024/06/29 12:14]  Dizzi Sternberg: but im on 3rd lesson
[2024/06/29 12:14]  Janet Rossini: yes. mosty a matter of thinking and practice
[2024/06/29 12:15]  Dizzi Sternberg: they say its about 14 lessons average
[2024/06/29 12:15]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:15]  Dizzi Sternberg: planing
[2024/06/29 12:15]  Janet Rossini: but an assessment week after next?
[2024/06/29 12:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: Information, Position, Speed, Gear, Acceleration
[2024/06/29 12:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: no
[2024/06/29 12:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: just a meet and greet with an examiner
[2024/06/29 12:16]  Dizzi Sternberg: and the rest of the people doing the course
[2024/06/29 12:16]  Janet Rossini: ah i see
[2024/06/29 12:17]  Dizzi Sternberg: so we can see hes human
[2024/06/29 12:17]  Dizzi Sternberg: :)
[2024/06/29 12:17]  Dizzi Sternberg: so i may not get back in time
[2024/06/29 12:18]  Dizzi Sternberg: ill probably stay out for less stress timewise
[2024/06/29 12:18]  Janet Rossini: ok. remind us that monday :)
[2024/06/29 12:18]  Dizzi Sternberg: ill have to drive back around york bypass
[2024/06/29 12:18]  Dizzi Sternberg: i will
[2024/06/29 12:19]  Dizzi Sternberg: so was pleasing that the free street charging worked ok
[2024/06/29 12:20]  Dizzi Sternberg: and the car took charge at a rate of 7kw
[2024/06/29 12:20]  Dizzi Sternberg: must be for people visiting pock
[2024/06/29 12:20]  Janet Rossini: yes that's good
[2024/06/29 12:20]  Dizzi Sternberg: park up and go shopping
[2024/06/29 12:21]  Dizzi Sternberg: get charge to go home
[2024/06/29 12:21]  Dizzi Sternberg: was cahrging at about 30 miles per hour
[2024/06/29 12:22]  Janet Rossini: yes
[2024/06/29 12:23]  Dizzi Sternberg: was just thinking, i bet that clock behind us would look great in PBR
[2024/06/29 12:24]  Janet Rossini: probably would, yes
[2024/06/29 12:24]  Janet Rossini: a lot of stuff would
[2024/06/29 12:26]  Dizzi Sternberg: the thin i also did today was to use that hue and saturation node to set a colour rathe than using a texture NS made which had 3 lights
[2024/06/29 12:26]  Dizzi Sternberg: for the world
[2024/06/29 12:26]  Dizzi Sternberg: since PBR now calculates all the shadows and reflections
[2024/06/29 12:27]  Janet Rossini: what would have happened without that background light?
[2024/06/29 12:27]  Dizzi Sternberg: i just wanted illumination from all angles
[2024/06/29 12:27]  Dizzi Sternberg: the texture would be black
[2024/06/29 12:27]  Janet Rossini: k
[2024/06/29 12:27]  Dizzi Sternberg: if you added a light source that would be baked in
[2024/06/29 12:27]  Dizzi Sternberg: like a spot lamp
[2024/06/29 12:28]  Dizzi Sternberg: i did that on shallots bed
[2024/06/29 12:29]  Dizzi Sternberg: i knew where the bedside lamps were
[2024/06/29 12:29]  Dizzi Sternberg: so i maked in the shadows
[2024/06/29 12:29]  Dizzi Sternberg: baked
[2024/06/29 12:30]  Dizzi Sternberg: we dont need to do that in PBR
[2024/06/29 12:30]  Janet Rossini: ok
[2024/06/29 12:30]  Janet Rossini: so i am supposing one just used PBR from here on out?
[2024/06/29 12:30]  Dizzi Sternberg: i think so
[2024/06/29 12:30]  Dizzi Sternberg: but as you saw its same two files
[2024/06/29 12:30]  Janet Rossini: although i guess legacy people see grey or something?
[2024/06/29 12:31]  Dizzi Sternberg: use old way or new
[2024/06/29 12:31]  Janet Rossini: but the object has to be one or the other?
[2024/06/29 12:31]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:31]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes legacy sees grey
[2024/06/29 12:31]  Dizzi Sternberg: like you did
[2024/06/29 12:31]  Janet Rossini: well * 'em
[2024/06/29 12:31]  Dizzi Sternberg: yes
[2024/06/29 12:32]  Janet Rossini: i should log, i guess
[2024/06/29 12:32]  Dizzi Sternberg: This stereo record cannot be played on old tin boxes no matter what thay are fitted with. If you are in possession of such equipment please hand it into the nearest police station.
